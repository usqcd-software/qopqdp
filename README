QOPQDP -- SciDAC Level 3 over QDP/C

------------------------------------------------------
--- below are some notes on the asqtad conventions ---
--- which are also similar to the wilson case --------
------------------------------------------------------

The dslash is accessed by:

void QOP_F3_asqtad_dslash(QOP_info_t *info,
                          QOP_F3_FermionLinksAsqtad *asqtad,
                          float mass,
                          QOP_F3_ColorVector *out,
                          QOP_F3_ColorVector *in,
                          QOP_evenodd_t eo_out,
                          QOP_evenodd_t eo_in);

where specifying different values of eo_out and eo_in will give the
corresponding parts of D.  If both are QOP_EVENODD then you get the
full matrix, both QOP_EVEN multiplies by just D_ee = m, and you can
also do things like eo_out=QOP_EVEN and eo_in=QOP_EVENODD.

The most important thing to note is that the inverter conventions have
now changed.  The result is now always of the form

out_subset = (D^-1)_subset in_subset

where subset is the one specified in the QOP_invert_arg_t and D is the
conventional Dslash.  In even-odd blocks this is

D = ( m     D_eo )
    ( D_oe  m    )

D^-1 = ( m A^-1      -D_eo B^-1 )
       ( -D_oe A^-1  m B^-1     )

with A = (m^2 - D_eo D_oe) and B = (m^2 - D_oe D_eo)

so specifying QOP_EVEN will now multiply by m/A instead of 1/(4A) as
it did before.  Thus the result will have to be scaled by 1/(4m) to
get the previous answer.  The main reason for this change is
consistency since now specifying QOP_EVENODD will give the full
inverse with the correct normalization which is very handy for writing
simple analysis codes.

Also starting in version 0.10.0 the residual returned is divided by the
norm of the input vector.
